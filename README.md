# Graduate School Java Projects README

This repository contains Java projects that I completed during my time in graduate school. Each project demonstrates specific programming and algorithmic skills. Below are brief descriptions of each project.

## Projects

### 1. Wumpus World

**Description:**  
In this project, I created a text-based game that simulates the classic Wumpus World game. The program uses artificial intelligence algorithms to make decisions for the in-game hunter.  

**Key Features:**
- Text-based User Interface
- Utilizes AI algorithms for decision-making
- Demonstrates the concept of agent-based modeling

**Technologies Used:**  
Java

### 2. Car Shop Inventory Management

**Description:**  
This project is a car shop inventory management application that lets you add cars, generate various reports, and search for cars based on specific conditions.  

**Key Features:**
- Adding cars to the inventory with complete details (model, make, year, etc.)
- Generating reports sorted by model, price, etc.
- Finding cars with the lowest mileage or price
- A robust menu system for users to interact with the inventory

**Technologies Used:**  
Java, ArrayList, HashMaps

### 3. Vacuum World Simulator

**Description:**  
This project simulates a vacuum cleaner navigating a grid. It uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the most efficient path to clean all the dirt in its environment.

**Key Features:**
- Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) for efficient pathfinding
- Simulates a 2D grid environment
- Keeps track of explored and frontier states

**Technologies Used:**  
Java, 2D Arrays

## Knowledge Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Artificial Intelligence Algorithms
- Data Structures (ArrayList, HashMap)
- Search Algorithms (BFS)
- User Input/Output handling
- Exception Handling

Feel free to explore each project to get a better understanding of the code and the technologies used.
